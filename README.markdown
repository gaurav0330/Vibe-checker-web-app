## 🛤️ Roadmap

- **Social Sharing**: Add one-click sharing to social media platforms.
- **Leaderboards**: Introduce global and friend-based leaderboards for scored quizzes.
- **Custom Themes**: Allow users to customize quiz UI with themes and colors.
- **Multi-Language Support**: Support quizzes in multiple languages.
- **Offline Mode**: Enable quiz-taking offline with sync on reconnection.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

- **Quiz Generation Fails**: Verify your Google Gemini API key is valid and has sufficient quota. Check server logs for details.
- **Authentication Issues**: Ensure Clerk keys are correct and the Clerk middleware is configured in `middleware.ts`.
- **Database Errors**: Confirm all tables and RLS policies are set up in Supabase. Check for missing columns or constraints (e.g., `is_correct` in `options` should be nullable).
- **Vibe Quiz Not Working**: Ensure the `option_interpretations` table is populated with `vibe_category` and `vibe_value`. Verify `/api/quiz/generate` inserts vibe data correctly.
- **JSON Parsing Errors**: If the Gemini API returns markdown-wrapped JSON, ensure `generateQuiz` in `src/lib/gemini.ts` strips code blocks properly.

For help, open a GitHub issue with detailed logs and steps to reproduce.
